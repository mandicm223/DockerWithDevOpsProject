# DockerWithDevOpsProject
In this project, I implemented Docker and NodeJS together. This is an express API connected with MongoDB and fed into Docker for more efficiency and scalability. All that is accessible from the browser via Nginx.
The project has Docker files for development and for the Production environment. 
API lets us authenticate the user as well as allow authenticated users to do CRUD operations on posts. 
In the production environment, we added a Docker swarm, so we have a little bit more control over our containers.
